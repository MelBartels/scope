Dear Don Ware:

I'm getting back to you concerning your request to reprint the data from
Roger W. Sinnott's NGC 2000.0 on the website of Mel Bartels, in connection
with the project for building a driver for a Dobsonian telescope.  

We have no objection to your reprinting the data as long as you carry a
credit line: 

NCC and IC data are taken from NGC 2000.0, edited by Roger W. Sinnott.
Copyright (c) 1988 by Sky Publishing Corp.  Reproduced with the permission
of the publisher. 

While it's true that the NGC data is available on public websites, Roger
Sinott's work correcting it (and Sky's publishing of it) makes that version
the property of Sky Publishing, so you were right to request permission to
reprint it.

Best wishes

Thanks for being in touch.  I'm not familiar with Mel Bartel's program. 
Can you enlighten me a bit more?   

Check the article Mel wrote for "Sky and Telescope," April 2000 pp128-133.   
Also see the URL for his website listed on p132. 


I don't know whether Mr. Bartel obtained 
permission from Sky to "excerpt" (if that's what he did) material from NGC 
2000.0 and reformat it.  

On Mel's website, he acknowledges sources for the databases he now
provides.   
The NGC database he provides was clearly NOT extracted from NGC2000.0 and  
only  lists some of the NGC objects and none of the IC objects.  I provided  
the Flamsteed database as acknowledged by him, (Follow the 'Contributors'  
link).  That data was obtained from public websites. 
  
I will look into this, but  meantime, if you would 
give me a bit more information about what you plan to do, and the 
background, I'd appreciate it.  


As I mentioned in my original e-mail, I took the data on NGC2000.0 and  
extracted it with a simple Basic program using the examples provided on the  
diskette.  I then reformated it using a Lotus 123 worksheet to put it into  
the format used by Mel's program. The result are files NGC0 - NGC7 covering  
objects NGC0001 through NGC7840 and IC0 - IC5 covering object IC0001
throught  
IC5386. 

It should be noted that most if not all the data on NGC2000.0 is available
on  
public websites.  The contribution of Roger Sinnott was to compile it all  
into one place and make corrections where necessary.  Rather then repeat his  
efforts, I used the NGC2000.0 diskette, so am asking permission to provide  
the information from it on Mel's website acknowleding the source 

Regards, 

Don Ware
